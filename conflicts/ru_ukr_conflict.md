## Board
### Situation per 7.5.22
After more than 2 months of war, further warfare may not improve negotiation positions of either site but cause unnecessary brutality and losses including to civilians for example when trying to conquer foreign cities which the Russian forces could try.

From a military perspective, the Ukrainian defenders seem able to reconquer some territory. One reason is that in recently occupied territory the Russian defenses are not (yet) strong and the support from the local population is not there or adverse. However, how much actual territorial regains improve their negotiation position is unclear since both sides likely are aware of this capability and other points such as lessening of current and prevention of further sanctions, the overall security framework and restoration of relations with Ukraine and others (such as the US and central and western European countries) are likely more important for Russia than some territory.
Broad Russian advances are less likely since the Ukrainian defenses are strong (fortified positions, the light modern weapons are very well suited to defend these fortified positions and they fight for and in their homeland which is a huge boost). An exception is to take control of a couple of unconquered bunkers in the Azovstal steelworks. However here too, an improvement in negotiation position is unclear as fully encircled bunkers come close to a (self-run) prison for the soldiers therein and thus seem better for negotiations than many new deaths on both sides. Limited attacks could be both tryouts for a storming as well as just a proof of will and capability to push negotiations. // The bloody battle can be spared for computer/console titles.
 
From prosperity and development perspective a stop of war seems crucial for both the Ukraine and for Russia: if the war escalates or continues much longer an increased and possibly permanent exodus of skilled workers respectively of the young generation which will significantly blow their scientific and economic capabilities (and thereby also the military capabilities) for the coming decades. A soon peace likely would stop or even reverse the exodus since most emigrants are not yet settled.




## Notes
* The focus is on human rights for individuals - many of which are violated in a war - and to search for all sides practicable paths to peace. For that reason to judge or point right/wrong doing is not the focus and it is attempted to take a neutral standpoint (subjective impressions are transparent in the [appendix](#appendix)).

* The United Nations and the Red Cross are considered important.

* The resources used are mainly Swiss German news sites and UK based news sites (bbc.com and the guardian.co.uk). Sometimes news agencies are visited such as reuters or tass. Overall the resources are biased towards news from Switzerland and the UK. As both countries have and value press freedom and the articles are read critically, it is hoped to achieve a coverage which is not overly biased.

* It is attempted to write always *factual & respectful & avoiding confrontation*, especially as this writing is public.
     > On the page about coronaviruses, sometimes the writing was heated and confrontational (written when stressed or joined the heated atmosphere) which was bad mistake and even counterproductive. Sorry.

* Likely: mistakes happen here and not all content is up to the task. 

* Feedback is welcome especially pointing out mistakes and improvement suggestions.

## Paths to Peace

Subjects officially in negotiation:
* A neutral status for the Ukraine combined with (legally binding) security guarantees (the guarantees from the Budapest memorandum have not been enough [clear]).
* Autonomy (of varying degrees) for Donbas


Subjects where the negotiation positions seem fare apart or which are not officially in negotiation:
* redesign of European security architecture (e.g. OSZE)
* status of Crimea - possibly by (local) referendum
* lessening sanctions on deal

Considerations for European and the World security:
* redesign of country groups to allow non exclusive membership (i.e. a country between two organizations can be member on both. Allow fluid borders i.e. part membership)

## Appendix
> ### Opinion on the Conflict
> The subjective opinion/judgement is: 
> * Serious violations of human rights occur in most wars. This invasion is no exception: The human rights of the people of the Ukraine are seriously violated. *War should never happen.*
> * The invasion is *not* in agreement with international laws regarding interactions between states. Yes, other military conflicts (including military conflicts in 90s and 00s) were started with violations of international laws too but one break does not justify another break. Tensions between Russia and the NATO/EU are acknowledged but these are *not* seen as a justification for an invasion/a military confrontation/a war. // Possibly it once was considered by the Russian government that limited military actions could be enough to force a government change in Kiev. Such a forceful externally induced government is also not considered legal by article 2 paragraph 4 of the [UN Charter](#un-charter).
> * Brutality including bombing of specified civilian areas or if civilians are hindered escaping is considered heartless. // So fare *no* systematic targeting of civilians seems to occur. Tough civilians got hit on many occasions. Each hit and death has its own history and people associated and thus is a tragedy on its own.
> 
> For the main text, the conflict is taken as given and the focus is on pathways to peace that work/are acceptable for all sides for that reason mostly a neutral/least common viewpoint is (tried to be) taken.
