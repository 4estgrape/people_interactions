## Tweet Summary
This page contains thoughts/considerations how we team up to larger groups. How we interact as individuals and as part of groups. Countries are considered as groups and settings for peaceful interactions are searched.


## Summary 
*A group* is used to denote a specific subset of a population of people. Teams are defined as groups with a common goal. Organizations are defined as organized teams. There are different forms of organizations possible. For most organizations forms the decision process is hierarchical.

Interactions between the different agents (individuals, groups, teams, organizations) are considered with the goal to identify settings which enable friendly interactions.
It is suggested, that friendly interactions are promoted, when 
* many members are included in the decision process
* membership is open
* there are many voluntary interactions
  > Voluntary is assumed in the following and not especially written for a better reading flow
* the teams are connected


When viewing countries as organizations, the above claims read: With many interactions and fluent borders the chance for friendly relations is higher. 
* With many people being involved in the decision process, the chance for friendly interactions is higher. As with many people it is more likely some are friends with the opposite party.
* When forming unions of countries, organizations with open membership and fluent borders are best at ensuring peace.
  > The United Nations is an open organization and in agreement it has a good track record at providing peace.
* Inside countries when the society is 'fair' and fluent (not fractioned into different classes), there is few space for class struggles.
  > Revolutions happened mainly in situations where a segregated and a small class controlled most of the wealth.
* Between countries, when there are lots of interactions especially at the leadership level, the chances for friendship is higher and thus the chances for tensions, hostile actions and especially war are lower.
  > When the decision makers are friends, hostile actions are rare.

  > => Meetings of parliament members are considered helpful. Parliaments member often are in office for quite long and additionally they are quite many so a parliament can have friend around the world.




## Relevance
* International Relations: How to design and promote. Whether or not to cut ties on conflicts.



## Groups, Teams and Organizations

> ###### Groups
> Groups are used here to denote fixed subsets from a certain collection of people having some common interest.

> ###### Teams
> Teams are defined as people working together towards a common goal.

> ###### Organizations
> Organizations are organized teams.

* *Relations between Groups, Teams and Organizations:* According to the definitions used here: 
  * teams are groups
  * organizations are teams

* *Decision Making:* Organizations are often structured hierarchically and the decision making follows often also a this pattern. The hierarchy can be fixed or changing. In teams which are not organized the decision making is individual.




## Individual and Team Interactions
Interactions can be viewed differently. Here only the following aspects of interactions are considered:
* An individual can act towards another individual [friendly, neutral or unfriendly](#friendliness-of-interactions)
* Two or more individuals can team up and form a team.

> ###### Friendliness of Interactions
> The actions are defined by: Friendly actions are appreciated by the 'receiver', neutral are indifferent and unfriendly actions are not appreciated.



### Relations and Interactions between Groups

##### Membership Relations Considered
* How groups/teams/organizations related each other namely whether there are many members [connecting](#membership-connection) them.
* How fluent the membership borders namely whether there are several degrees of membership and what are the conditions on becoming member

> Membership intersections && connections are especially important at the decision level i.e. when the leaders of team A and team B are well connoted, a friendly relationship is more likely. 

> ##### Membership Connection
> A group G *connects* the members of team A to team B if G contains members of team A and team B.

Example of a Membership Connection:
Usually persons are member of exactly one country => countries have usually distinct members. If an organization Org (e.g. WWF, FIFA, ISS or commercial such as Nestle/CocaCola/Gazprom/Renault) operates in both countries, the members of country A and of country B are members of Org and thus Org connects country A and country B.



#### Group Memberships and Interactions
##### Interactions Considered
Teams can compete or cooperate in various ways or have no connection. Here considered are: 
* The 'friendliness' of interactions: friendly, neutral or hostile interactions.
* The frequency of interactions



#### The Interplay between Membership Relations and Interactions
* Teams with intersections (members belonging to both teams), mostly have friendly or at least neutral interactions and nearly never hostile interactions. One reason is that usually unfriendly interactions are stopped and friendly interactions increased.
* If team A and team B have many connections (), the chance for hostile actions is quite low.





## Examples

### Ancient Times
In ancient times the central units where tribes and later monarchies/feudal systems:
* Tribes: An ancient form of organizations are tribes. Over time tribes transformed or united to communes/countries and companies.
* Feudal Systems: The nobility governs land provided by the monarch and in turn pays tribute and provides military services.

=> In ancient times, the people were often only part of only one team holding power namely the feudal lord and the ruling monarch. Violent conflicts were frequent at those times.

### Modern World
In modern times one is usually part of different teams/organizations which hold power and property:
* Countries: The population living in a certain area belongs to a country. The decision structure in countries is usually highly organized and hierarchically. In democracies the top members are determined by elections. In direct democracies the decision process itself is also subject to votes. Countries are often subdivided in administrative districts enabling decentralization. Regarding peace and war, countries are the most important organizational unit since the military command is usually per country. 
  > Often the larger the population part that takes part in a country's decision process, the less likely the country will start a war. Wars are started rarely with the supported of a large share of the population. [todo statistics]

  > Many countries have a single leader, often with large power. Being perfect, every day, for years is nearly impossibly i.e. even if brilliant in sudden unforeseen situations mistakes can happen. // There are exceptions: In Switzerland the decision power is equally distributed across 7 members of the Bundesrat. In some countries there were/are Politburos which take important decisions [to check decision making and country specific power]. Possibly this makes decisions more stable and less influenced by situation specific moods (we all are humans).

* Companies: The structure in companies is usually hierarchically. Mostly the top governing members are directly or indirectly elected by the owners. The employees only in very rare cases have any rights to be part in the decision making.
* Social organizations: E.g. sport clubs, political parties.
* Churches: Religions are highly divers reaching from explanations of schools of life to concrete laws and how to behave to various forms of ideologies.

> In the beginning of the 21th century people are often parts of several teams with power: The company associated (work, ownership), social organizations and the country of living.
